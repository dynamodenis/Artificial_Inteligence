## 🚀 Course Overview

During this course, I learned and implemented the core techniques behind **AI, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning**, applying them to practical projects that simulate real-world challenges.

### Key Areas Covered:
- Understanding and applying **Reinforcement Learning** principles  
- Building intelligent agents using **Q-Learning**, **Deep Q-Learning**, **A3C**, **PPO**, and **SAC** algorithms  
- Applying **Deep Learning** concepts to control and decision-making tasks  
- Fine-tuning **Foundation Models (LLMs)** for domain-specific applications  
- Hosting and deploying AI models using **Gradio** and **Hugging Face Spaces**
